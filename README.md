# Pneumonia-Detection

Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, especially among children under five years and the elderly. It is caused by various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, which inflame the lung's air sacs, leading to symptoms such as cough, fever, and difficulty breathing. Accurate diagnosis typically involves imaging techniques like chest X-rays, supplemented by clinical evaluations.

The increasing burden on healthcare systems necessitates the use of automated tools to assist radiologists in diagnosing pneumonia efficiently. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has shown promise in medical imaging tasks. This project explores the application of CNNs and other architectures to classify chest X-ray images into pneumonia or normal categories, aiming to provide a robust tool for early detection.

# Aim

The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep learning-based binary classification model to detect pneumonia using chest X-ray images with high accuracy. The secondary objectives include:

 1. Evaluating the performance of different deep learning architectures.
 2. Identifying challenges associated with the dataset and implementation.
 3. Proposing future enhancements to improve model accuracy and usability.
